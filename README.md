Description

This is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. The AI makes optimal moves, ensuring a challenging and fair gameplay experience. The game runs in the command-line interface (CLI) and follows standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules.

Features

Play against an unbeatable AI opponent.

Uses the Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making.

Simple text-based interface.

Checks for valid moves and prevents invalid inputs.

Detects wins, draws, and provides game results.

How to Play

Run the Python script.

The game board will be displayed.

You play as X, and the AI plays as O.

Enter your move by specifying the row and column numbers (e.g., 1 2 for row 1, column 2).

The AI will calculate its best move and play accordingly.

The game continues until someone wins or the board is full.

Installation

Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).

Download the tic_tac_toe.py script.

Run the script using:
